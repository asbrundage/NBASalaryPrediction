## Data Prep

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

injuriessum <-
  injuries %>%
  filter(!is.na(Team)) %>%
  count(Relinquised) %>%
  rename("numberofinjuries" = "n") 

awardtotal <-
  awards %>%
  # filter(Award == "MVP") %>%
  count(PLAYER ) %>%
  rename("numberofawards" = "n")

  mutate(numberofseasons = Year - RookieYear) 

prioriyearsal <-
  salary2016 %>%
  group_by(`Player.Name`) %>%
  summarise(PriorYear = sum(`Salary.in..`))

salarycombined <-

  left_join(injuriessum, by = c("Player" = "Relinquised")) %>%

  # filter("Year" =="RookieYear") 
  # kable()
# seasons
# kable()


```

##Get Data from NBAloveR

```{r}
Kobe <- 
  players %>%
  group_by(Player) %>%
  top_n(1,Year) %>%
  mutate(numberofseasons = Year - RookieYear) %>%
  # filter(Player =="Stephen Curry") %>%
  kable()
Kobe
head(players)
# kable()
```

##Model

```{r}
ModelNBA <- lm(Salary
              ~ numberofseasons 
              + PriorYear
              # + ExpSq
              # + ed
              # + race
              # + sex
              # + race_black
              # + race_hispanic
              # + race_other
              # + age
              , data = salarycombined)

summary(ModelNBA)
